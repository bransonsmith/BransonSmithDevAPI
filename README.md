# BransonSmithDevAPI

This was the backend of my personal website, that I wrote years ago. It is no longer in use, and has no infrastructure configured.
I rolled my own auth in this application, as well as developed my own simple ORM, logging middleware, and set up my own mvc pattern.
This was all when I was first learning about setting up my own web server, and was helpful for me to know how these things work.

Now days, I use published services/frameworks, but this was a fun learning project.

I published it along with it's (old)secrets (uh oh) for the purposes of having the node code available to show, even if it doesn't have a valid db/secret setup anymore.
